title: 'Zoroark: Master of Illusions'
---
The [thirteen movie][M13] left to it's own scheduling interrupts Ash's
participation in the Sinnoh League competition. Ash also makes significant
changes to his roster at the start of competition, signaling that this movie
takes place before the competition rather than afterward.

Although these events occur in [`DP182`][DP182], another problem is that the
league takes place on _Lily of the Valley Island_ whereas the movie features
_Crown City_ as it's setting, which shows no sign of being on an island.

Finally, the episode in which Ash & friends [board the ferry][DP180] from
_Sunnyshore Port_ to the island immediately follows [an episode][DP179] also
set in _Sunnyshore_, pushing the movie back one more episode.
