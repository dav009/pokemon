title: Diancie & Fletchling
---
The [Diancie movie][M17], much to the disappointment of some fans, spoiled the
[evolution of Ash's Fletchling][XY036] by incorporating Fletchinder a week
prior to the evolution taking place on TV screens. Pushing the movie and it's
related specials back a week solves the continuity issues and ensures that
future viewers will not be spoilered in the same way.
