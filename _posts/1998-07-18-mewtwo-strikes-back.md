title: Mewtwo Strikes Back
---
Even the [first Pok√©mon movie][M01] didn't manage to escape the turbulence set
in motion by the [four month hiatus][hiatus]. A [trio][EP063] [of][EP064]
[episodes][EP065] feature Mewtwo in what was to be the build up to the movie,
however due to the hiatus, these episodes eventually aired several months after
the movie's release.

The easiest way to fix this is to simply move Mewtwo Strikes Back, and the
[pikachu special][PK01] associated with it to just after `EP065`; the final
episode of the trio to showcase Mewtwo.
