At most only one of [these movies][M14] can be considered even close to cannon
due to fundamental contractions. Both will be scheduled together so that the
watcher may choose which to incorporate into their own personal experience.

As the original release date places them in the middle of the
[_Nimbasa_][BW038] [_City_][BW039] [Club][BW040] [Battle][BW041]
[tournament][BW042], moving them just prior to that arc seems as good
a solution as any.
