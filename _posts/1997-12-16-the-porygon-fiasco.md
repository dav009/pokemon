title: The Porygon Fiasco
---
Strobe effects in [`EP038`][EP038] lead to an unplanned four month hiatus of the
Pok√©mon anime. Due to this two [winter][UN02] [specials][UN03] were skipped
over (they eventually made it to air in the Fall of 1998), and a [PSA][UN01]
was created to explain the incident.

Therefore in order to fix the continuity, the two specials get placed
immediately after the PSA.
