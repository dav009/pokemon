title: Brock's Egg
---
After [moving][hinamatsuri] [`EP052`][EP052], it becomes conspicuous for it's
lack of reference to the egg found in the now [previous episode][EP046]. To
solve this issue without disturbing the Hinamatsuri episode, we simply swap the
epsiodes now adjacent to it.

Thankfully [`EP047`][EP047], doesn't mention the egg or have other problematic
external refences, so swapping it with `EP046` serves as a painless fix.
