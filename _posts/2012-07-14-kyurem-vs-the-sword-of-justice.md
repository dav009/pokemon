title: Kyurem vs The Sword of Justice

[Movie Fifteen][M15] was released at a time when [Dawn][BW085] was travelling
with [Ash][BW093] in the anime, yet she does not appear in the film so some
movement is required. Meloetta is also absent, yet during the time Meloetta
follows Ash it makes frequent appearances especially when Ash is in peril, so
the movie likely occurs outside of [this][BW082] [arc][BW097].

Making the assumption that the movie occurs before the Meloetta arc, it must
also occur prior to [`BW081`][BW081] which sees the group board a boat until
`BW082`. This appears to be best place, as geographically there doesn't seem to
be enough space between [_Twist Mountain_][BW076] and [_Icirrus City_][BW079]
for _Roshan City_ (setting of the movie) to exist in.
