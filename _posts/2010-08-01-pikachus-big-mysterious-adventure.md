title: Pikachu's Big Mysterious Adventure
---
Originally released in the middle of the Sinnoh League this [Pikachu
short][PK21] needed to be relocated. The opening shot features a built up city
on the edge of a body of water, which doesn't match what gets seen of either
_Sunnyshore_ or _Lily of the Valley Island_.

Since [`DP181`][DP181] shows the ferry stopping along the way for supplies,
it's possible that this unnamed city is another one of these stops, so lets
place it in that window.
