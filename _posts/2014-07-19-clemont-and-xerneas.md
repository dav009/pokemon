title: Clemont & Xerneas
---
The [Diancie movie][M17], much to the disappointment of some fans, spoiled the
[evolution of Ash's Fletchling][XY036] by incorporating Fletchinder a week
prior to the evolution taking place on TV screens. The temptation is to solve
this by simply pushing the movie and it's related specials back a week to solve
the continuity issues and ensure that future viewers will not be spoilered in
the same way.

However in a slightly [later episode][XY041] Xerneas appears and goes
unrecognised by all but Clemont, who seems ready to name that Pokémon just
before being interupted by Tierno.

> Astounding! Is that--

> -- a pokémon? Amazing!

This also fits with Clemont's familiarity with the legend of Xerneas portrayed
in the film. Since there's no roster changes and no real change in geography
(still being on _Route 11_) it seems acceptable to push the movie back until
the close of the [Pokémon][XY039] [Summer][XY040] [Camp][XY041] [arc][XY042],
just before Ash's arrival at _Shalour City_.
