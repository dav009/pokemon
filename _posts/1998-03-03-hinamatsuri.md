title: Hinamatsuri
---
When Pokémon came back on air (following the [hiatus][hiatus]) the schedule
suffered accordingly. The [Hinamatsuri episode][EP052], ended up airing on July
9th, four months after the festival on which it focused (March 3rd). This also
introduced continuity errors, as it featured the debut of Jessie's Lickitung
a pokémon referenced [several episodes prior][EP049] with no introduction.

As we know the [planned airdate][schedule] for [`EP044`][EP044], and that new
episodes were to broadcast on each Tuesday, we only need to count forward three
weeks until we hit March 3rd. This tentatively allows us to place `EP052`, just
after [`EP046`][EP046]. Unfortunately, this doesn't solve all problems in their
area, but a future edit will take care of that.
