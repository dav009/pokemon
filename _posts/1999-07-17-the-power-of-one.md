Going strictly off of air/release dates, [`M02`][M02] gets listed immediately
prior to [`EP105`][EP105] where Ash's Charizard finally becomes obedient. The
problem with this is that in the movie, Charizard shows no signs of being
disobedient. At one point Charizard even ends up pulling a sled being ridden by
Ash. These actions taken together make more sense if Charizard is already
obedient, which can be fixed by pushing `M02` back one episode.

However there's [some speculation][update] that the original airdate placement
is correct, based on the geography of the [_Orange Archipelago_][location]. Ash
and friends visit [_Trovita_][EP104], [_Cleopatra_][EP105] and
[_Ascorbia_][EP106] islands in that order. While the movie takes place on
_Shamouti Island_ which is logically visited while travelling between _Trovita_
and _Cleopatra_ islands.

While this argument makes sense, the reason given in the movie for them
visiting _Shamouti_ at all is being dragged there by anomalous bad weather seen
all the way to _Palet Town_. It's therefore not beyond the realm of possibility
for this to have occured just after leaving _Cleopatra_ rather than before, so
for now at least Charizard's behavior wins out.

Unfortunately there is another continuity error introduced by Prof Oak's and
Tracey's meeting at the end of the movie. In [subsequent][EP114]
[episodes][EP115] Tracey expresses excitement at meeting Prof Oak in person.
This is unresolvable (by reordering) as attempting to place the movie after
these episodes leads to other errors. Namely that Lapras, who appears in the
movie, is released during [`EP113`][EP113] and that Ash and friends leave the
Orange Islands (the location of the movie) at the end of `EP114`.

Seemingly the best explanation available for this is simply that Tracey didn't
get much chance to speak to Prof Oak immediately following the movie, and that
his excitement is more about that than merely meeting the professor in person.
