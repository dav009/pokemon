Unfortunate scheduling meant that this [special][SS012] about Team Rocket aired
between two [consecutive][AG044] [episodes][AG045] with a story arc focusing on
Misty and Togepi.

As it begins with Team Rocket already in the middle of a blast-off, it makes
more sense to place it just before the Togepi arc, as while the
[preceding][AG043] episode concludes with them blasting-off, the Togepi arc
sees them escape realtively unscathed.
