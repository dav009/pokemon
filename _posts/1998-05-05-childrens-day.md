title: Children's Day
---
Another casualty of the [hiatus][hiatus] was [`EP053`][EP053], the Children's
Day episode. Having missed May 5th, it eventually aired on July 28th 1998.

Unfortunately placing this based on intended airdate (arrived at by counting
Tuesdays and episodes forward from the [new location][hinamatsuri] of
[`EP052`][EP052]) interrupts the [Todd][EP055] [story][EP056] [arc][EP057].
Speculation is that there would have been a double broadcast at some point in
the preceding months, meaning this episode would air the week after the arc
concluded.

While unconfirmed, this seems like a reasonable guess and as such will be
included here. As it does not impact the story (it's basically zero-sum filler)
there is some debate on whether it should be moved or left in place where it
eventually aired, as such consider this edit somewhat optional.
