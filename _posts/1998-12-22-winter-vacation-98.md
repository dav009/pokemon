title: Winter Vacation '98
---
In what appears to be the last bit of fallout from the previous year's
[hiatus][hiatus], Pikachu's [Winter][PK02] [Vacation][PK03] aired smack-bang in
the middle of the Indigo League competition story arc.

It's probable that had it been possible to follow the original schedule, the
Indigo League would have already concluded by the Winter Holidays, and not
ended up spanning the new year. Given this and lack of other significant
markers, it seems to make sense to place these specials after that arc.

However, story progresses somewhat rapidly toward the Orange Islands once the
league wraps up, and there's not really a fitting place for these specials to
live post-league without breaking that flow. Others have deigned to remedy this
by placing them before the league starts instead, which works due to the lack
of landmarks within them.

In the absense of a "better" or more concrete solution it makes sense to follow
that line of reasoning. If you know of a better/more accurate one, please get
in touch!
