title: 'Pok√©mon Ranger: Guardian Signs'
---
The [Guardian][SS022] [Signs][SS023] arc of specials aired interleaved with the
_[Sunyshore][DP165] [City][DP166]_ arc. Since the plots don't crossover, this
is likely a symptom of TV scheduling rather than intent, so there's no reason
not to group them by arc. Since Guardian Signs started later, it makes sense to
move that arc.
