title: 'Jirachi: Wish Maker'
---
This [movie][M06] was released as the anime was airing an arc of episodes in
which Ash and friends stayed in [Slateport][AG033] [City][AG034]. The movie
occurs outside of any built up area, so it makes sense to push the movie back
until just after they leave the city, [two][AG035] [episodes][AG036] later.
