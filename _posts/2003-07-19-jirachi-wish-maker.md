title: 'Jirachi: Wish Maker'

This [movie][M06] was released as the anime was airing an arc of episodes in
which Ash and friends stayed in [Slateport][AG033] [City][AG034]. The movie
occurs outside of any built up area, so it's pretty certain this is not
a correct placement.

The anime movie map shows that the movie takes place just south of
_Fallarbor Town_, so it would make sense for it to take place around the same
time as May's Pok√©mon Contest there. However the absence May's Skitty suggests
it probably takes place prior to [`AG047`][AG047]. The solution that seems to
fit best is that it took place during a detour south on the way to _Fallarbor
Town_.

This leaves a window of possibility between [`AG040`][AG040] and `AG047`. Given
the location's proximity to _Fallarbor Town_, the later in that leg of the
journey, the better. Thus ideal placement seems to be just prior to `AG047`.
