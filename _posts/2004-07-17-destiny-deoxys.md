Plot alone doesn't offer any compelling reason to alter the placement of
[`M07`][M07], however geography does. The anime movie map shows that it's set
in a city north-west of _Lilycove City_, which locks down a placement window of
between [`AG085`][AG085] and [`AG090`][AG090].

The airdate placement meets these criteria, however the map also suggests (via
the depiction of Plusle and Minun), that [`PK13`][PK13] occurs just north of
the movie's setting. As Ash and friends are travelling south-east, it seems
logical to place `M07` just after `PK13`.
