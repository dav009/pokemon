title: Pikachu's Ocean Adventure

[`PK16`][PK16] doesn't quite fit with it's release date due to the inclusion of
Ash's Aipom. The mischevious pok√©mon first appears [one episode][AG179] later,
but is not captured until [`AG182`][AG182].

The trailer appears to show Aipom fully integrated with the group, so it seems
likely that this takes place after her capture. It's worth noting that other
lists prefer to place this short immediately after Aipom's debut, however due
to the trailer evidence it will be placed post-capture.
